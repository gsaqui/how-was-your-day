__How was your day__
This is a very simple firefox os app that asks you everyday how your day was.  The client is created with phonegap as I would like to work towards to generating code for both ios and android.

__TODO__
- Have a proper flow from starting app for the first time to logging in multiple times
- Allow people to fillin days in the past
- When notification asks how your day was allow for it to go to the view that handles it
- Create a backend to handle signup, sending notifications, and keeping all the data
